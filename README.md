# C++ Notes and Tutorials

This repository is a quick guide and reference for rapid and efficient
algorithm programming in C++. Standard containers and algorithms are
discussed heavily.

# Documents

| File              | Description
|:------------------|:--
| `stl-overview.md` | A quick overview of the STL.
| `icpc/`           | A collection of example problems that are trivial when using the STL.
| `tutorials/`      | A collection of tutorials on individual containers and algorithms.

# Notes

- The programs in `icpc/` take input from the `.in` files,
  as required by the [ICPC Mid-Central Region][midcentral];
  however, the [ICPC Live Archive][icpc] usually requires programs to
  take input from `stdin`, so be sure to modify the programs appropriately
  if you plan on submitting them for judging.

- The techniques shown in this repository are guaranteed to be the
  most efficient techniques only in the average case.
  Efficiency is measured by observing speed, memory usage, and code simplicity.
